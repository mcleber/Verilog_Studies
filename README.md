## Arithmetic Operators:

- **`**`**: Exponentiation
- **`*`**: Product
- **`/`**: Division
- **`%`**: Modulus or Remainder
- **`+`**: Sum
- **`-`**: Difference

---

## Relational Operators:

- **`>`**: Greater than
- **`>=`**: Greater than or equal
- **`<`**: Less than
- **`<=`**: Less than or equal

---

## Bitwise Operators:

- **AND Operator `&`**: Returns 1 if both operands are 1.
- **OR Operator `|`**: Returns 1 if at least one of the operands is 1.
- **NOT Operator `~`**: Inverts the logical value of the operand (if itâ€™s 0, it becomes 1, and vice versa).
- **XOR Operator `^`**: Returns 1 if the operands are different (if one is 1 and the other is 0).

> This type of signal manipulation is common in digital circuits, where logical operations are used to control data flow and conditions.

## Logical Operators:

- **`!`**: Logical NOT (inverts the bits).
- **`&&`**: Logical AND (returns 1 if both bits are 1).
- **`||`**: Logical OR (returns 1 if at least one bit is 1).

## Summary:

- Use **`&`** when you need to compare bit by bit between two values.
- Use **`&&`** when you need to evaluate a logical condition between two values, returning 1 (true) or 0 (false).

## Equality Operators:

### Logical Equality (for design):
- **`==`**: Equal
- **`!=`**: Not equal

### Case Equality (for testbench):
- **`===`**: Case equality
- **`!==`**: Case inequality

> If logical equality operators get variables with Z (high impedance) or X (unknown) values, then the result can be unknown.

---

## Concatenation Operator:

- **`{}`**: Concatenation

> Join bits from different vectors to form a new vector.

---

## Replication Operator:

- **`{{}}`**: Replication

> Concatenation performed for a fixed number of times.

> Syntax: {<number_times>{<some_binary_value>}}

> Example: a[5:0] = {3{b[1:0]}} means a[5:0] = {b[1:0], b[1:0], b[1:0]}

## Operator Precedence

#### 1. **Unary (highest)**
- Unary operators have the highest precedence.
- Examples: 
  - **`+`**: Unary plus (positive sign)
  - **`-`**: Unary minus (negation)
  - **`!`**: Logical NOT (inverts the bits)
  - **`~`**: Bitwise NOT (inverts the bits)

#### 2. **Exponentiation**
- Exponentiation (if supported) is evaluated next.
- Example: **`**`** (Exponentiation)

#### 3. **Arithmetic Operators**
- Arithmetic operations like multiplication, division, and modulus come after exponentiation.
- Examples:
  - **`*`**: Multiplication
  - **`/`**: Division
  - **`%`**: Modulus (remainder)

#### 4. **Shift Operators**
- Shift operators are evaluated after arithmetic operations.
- Examples:
  - **`<<`**: Logical left shift
  - **`>>`**: Logical right shift

#### 5. **Relational Operators**
- Relational operators are used for comparison and come after arithmetic and shift operations.
- Examples:
  - **`>`**: Greater than
  - **`>=`**: Greater than or equal
  - **`<`**: Less than
  - **`<=`**: Less than or equal

#### 6. **Equality Operators**
- Equality operators check if values are equal or not, and are evaluated after relational operators.
- Examples:
  - **`==`**: Equal
  - **`!=`**: Not equal

#### 7. **Bitwise Operators**
- Bitwise operators perform bit-level operations and are evaluated after equality operators.
- Examples:
  - **`&`**: Bitwise AND
  - **`^`**: Bitwise XOR
  - **`|`**: Bitwise OR

#### 8. **Logical Operators**
- Logical operators are evaluated after bitwise operations.
- Examples:
  - **`&&`**: Logical AND
  - **`||`**: Logical OR

#### 9. **Conditional Operators**
- Conditional operators are evaluated after logical operators.
- Example:
  - **`? :`**: Ternary conditional (if-else)

#### 10. **Concatenation (lowest)**
- Concatenation has the lowest precedence in Verilog.
- Example:
  - **`{}`**: Concatenation operator (combines multiple bits or signals)
