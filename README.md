# Brief explanation

### Arithmetic Operators:
( ** ) exponentiation

( * ) product

( / ) division

( % ) module or remainder

( + ) sum

( - ) difference

_________

### Bitwise Operators:
AND Operator (&): Returns 1 if both operands are 1.

OR Operator (|): Returns 1 if at least one of the operands is 1.

NOT Operator (~): Inverts the logical value of the operand (if itâ€™s 0, it becomes 1, and vice versa).

XOR Operator (^): Returns 1 if the operands are different (if one is 1 and the other is 0).

This type of signal manipulation is common in digital circuits, where logical operations are used to control data flow and conditions.

### Logical Operators:
!: Logical NOT (inverts the bits).

&&: Logical AND (returns 1 if both bits are 1).

||: Logical OR (returns 1 if at least one bit is 1).

### Summary:
Use & when you need to compare bit by bit between two values.

Use && when you need to evaluate a logical condition between two values, returning 1 (true) or 0 (false).
